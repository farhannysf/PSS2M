[Work in Progress Mod] 

You are now liberated and free to choose whatever magazines and scopes that you desire.

This mod release is quite symbolic. The mod content is originally uploaded by nzfdcrash (BWI) [Pindad SS2 Series](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2111525684) and reverse engineered for various improvements and fix such as CBA magazine wells support, top joint rails compatibility, dispersion and fire rate adjustment, which takes quite an effort solo because freedom is not free. This release is uploaded without permission from the original creator because  "Yar Har do what you want cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate!"  and while this is rightfully Indonesian, lest not forget and give thanks to the mod's original uploader nzfdcrash and the ANZAC people.
